## Hello Everyone! 
- I am Isaac McSorley. I am from Southeast Iowa and currently live in Iowa City, IA
- I am a Business Analytics and Information Systems major at The University of Iowa currently in my senior year. I am also pursing a masters degree in the field. 
- I am interested in anything analytics, tech, or machine learning related! I also love hunting, golfing, and anything outdoors!
- I have experience in both analytics and in finance. I worked on the product analytics team at HNI Corporation and am currently working on the product finance team at JP Morgan Chase. I also am a student intern for the college of nursing helping them design and implement a new database during the school year.         
- Check out some of my projects I have been working on [here](https://github.com/immcsorley?tab=repositories) or view below.
